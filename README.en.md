# Number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil

*Tip: when cloning it is highly recommended to use a depth of just 1 commit, as there are several daily updates, with `git clone --depth 1`.*

A dataset with numbers of COVID-19 in Brazil. There is data available for cases and deaths at the municipality level, with official information given by [Ministério da Saúde](https://covid.saude.gov.br/), and official federative units reports via [Brasil.IO](https://brasil.io/dataset/covid19/caso). Data for suspected cases and vaccines (first and second doses) are also available, collected by [@coronavirusbra1](https://coronavirusbra1.github.io/). Other data, such as recovered and tests were extracted from @coronavirusbra1 until October 2020, and now come from [Giscard](http://www.giscard.com.br/coronavirus/), with corrections and retroactive updates. The numbers of cases and deaths for the current day by federative unit level can be extract from [Giscard](http://www.giscard.com.br/coronavirus/)'s data, while the temporal evolution is given exclusively by Ministério da Saúde (with some corrections, see [
_fixes_meta.csv](
_fixes_meta.csv)) and Brasil.IO.

It is worth stressing that all data provided here are by the *release date* of reports from each federative unit. Take care when interpreting these data.

This dataset is maintained exclusively by me, [Wesley Cota](https://wesleycota.com/), with daily updates from different sources. The webpage <https://covid19br.wcota.me/en/> presents graphs and more information provided by this dataset.
